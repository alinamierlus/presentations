        Comparing Firefox OS with Android or iOS head-on is therefore a pointless idea. The aim of Firefox OS is to replace feature phones in emerging markets. True to the main goal of Mozilla to keep the web open and affordable to everyone. It can not be that a means of mass communication and information is only for the rich in certain markets. The web is a voice for a lot of people who can not speak otherwise as their mass media is controlled. Therefore mobile web access needs to be affordable and easy for everyone.

    <footer class="notes">
      The one and only technology used in Firefox OS is HTML5. The interface of the operating system is written in it, all apps are and the access to the hardware is defined in JavaScript APIs. This means that we can re-use a lot of the already existing code on the web and the system is very easy to upgrade and extend. Apps tend to be smaller and simpler, but also more cost-efficient to use. This is also something that is very important in emerging markets.

      Almost everyone we talked to at Mobile World Congress had preconceptions of HTML5 being unable to do certain things that native apps can. This ranged from 3D gaming up to working offline. Most of these assumptions are wrong, and the reason is how we measure the usefulness of HTML5.

    <footer class="notes">
      A lot of what HTML5 is accused of failing at is actually the fault of native platforms not allowing browsers to access function-critical hardware, or plain wrong implementations in stock browsers. This issue is exacerbated as stock browsers only update when the OS updates. That way older hardware is doomed to display HTML5 sub-par.

        This was one of the main reasons why Mozilla came up with Firefox OS - back then called Boot to Gecko. We wanted to find a way to access the hardware that makes mobile devices interesting from the web stack. And that we did. Using open standards - the Web APIs - defined and shared across the market we allow JavaScript developer to access the hardware in mobile devices directly without having to convert to Java or Objective-C.

      Of course from a security point of view there is no way we can allow any unknown server and code to access all the hardware on the device. That is why Firefox OS runs a packaged App format called Open Web Apps.

        Firefox OS has a marketplace for apps - much like any other platform out there. The Marketplace itself is an HTML5 app based on APIs for installing, de-installing and billing for apps. This allows partners to also build their own white-labeled marketplaces.

        The really cool differentiator though is that as the apps are HTML5, they can be indexed and searched. That way Firefox OS offers a functionality to search apps by content type. This means that if you enter the name of a band, you get apps with their music, their lyrics, videos or just information about them offered to you. These are mobile HTML5 apps which means you can try them out and install them in a second step if you like them. A try before you buy so to say. With Firefox OS we made apps as easy to discover and consume as the web is right now.

      It can appear annoying that not all HTML5 apps can access everything in the phone but the sad truth is that it is too easy to abuse a system that would be this open. Therefore we need to have a security review and capability framework in place. This doesn't mean though that you can not access the hardware at all - it means that you can ask the end user to do it on your behalf.

      Web Activities is a standards proposal to trigger a user interaction that is part of the operating system. Instead of using the functionality of the OS you use it with a user-initiated action. That way you don't have the security issue you'd have by accessing the functionality on behalf of the users and without notifying them. This is a concept from Android where it is called intents. Chrome until recently also had Web Intents but pulled them a short while ago because of UX issues on the Desktop.

      When initiating a Web Activity, the end user gets prompted to allow it. For example a pick activity would ask them to get images from the pictures or wallpaper folder or take a new photo. This is the beauty of activities - as a developer I don't care where content comes from or where it goes. Instead I leave that up to the user. Much like a right-click on any file on your hard-drive allows you to open it in your program of choice.

      A lot of people ask about IDEs and development environments. There are no fixes ones. As Firefox OS uses the same engine as Firefox on Desktop you can use the Developer Tools in the browser to get 90% of the way to your own app. You can use the Responsive Design Mode to see your app in 320 x 480 resolution and you can analyse the CSS, JavaScript and net requests with the in-build inspectors.

        All in all we can be assured that the web is far from dead and replaced by walled gardens. If anything, I am sure that a lot of predictions that everything just works in one environment and as developers it makes most sense to concentrate on that will become very much outdated this year. The web is an existing, world-wide distribution platform and reaches millions of people already with many more to come. Firefox OS is one step to bring web mobile connectivity to those who can not afford the other platforms. This is exciting and very much in the spirit of the web. And nothing stops you from packaging your HTML5 apps as native. The other way around doesn't work.
